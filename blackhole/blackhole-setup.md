# Installing [BlackHole] macOS

```bash
brew install blackhole-2ch
```

Then restart core audio, for good measure

```bash
sudo launchctl kickstart -kp system/com.apple.coreaudiod
```

`BlackHole 2ch` (2-channel) sound output device should appear. This can be
configured the same as any other sound output device.

See [[camilladsp/camilladsp-setup]] for example usage.
